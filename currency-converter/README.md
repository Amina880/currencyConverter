# Currency Converter 

In this project, I created a currency converter app. I was intrigued by this project because I have always wanted to create such a web application from the ground up. This was a great opportunity to build on the concepts I had already learnt in the Frontend ALX program such as integrating APIs, managing state, and designing a responsive and visually appealing user interface.
The app is a simple yet powerful tool designed to make international conversions a breeze. With real-time exchange rates, an easy-to-use interface, and the ability to bookmark favorite conversions, itâ€™s perfect for travelers, business professionals, and anyone handling multiple currencies.

This was set up as a React Project using:
TailwindCSS for styling
React Router for routing 
Axios for data requests from the ExchangeRate-API 
Vercel for deployment


The main features are:
Fetches Real-Time Exchange Rate Data
Currency Conversion Functionality
Displays Exchange Rate Information
Bookmarked Currency Conversions 
Responsive UI Design
Error Handling
